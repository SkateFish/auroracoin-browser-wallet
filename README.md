Security
--------

The private key is stored securely in your local browser storage and you may choose to encrypt it, 
for added Security. 

Transactions are signed in the browser and are published to Auroracoin Network via Insight.auroracoin.is. 

The private key will only leave the browser to be synced with other Chrome browsers you are signed into, 
This is managed by the Browser Software. 

Encrypting the private key ensures that nobody will know the private key without the password, not even this extension.
